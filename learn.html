            <h3>What is Transmission media?</h3>
            <p>
                Transmission media is a communication channel that carries the information from the sender to the receiver. Data is transmitted through the electromagnetic signals. The main functionality of the transmission media is to carry the information in the form
                of bits through LAN(Local Area Network). It is a physical path between transmitter and receiver in data communication. In a copper-based network, the bits in the form of electrical signals. In a fibre based network, the bits in the form
                of light pulses. In OSI(Open System Interconnection) phase, transmission media supports the Layer 1. Therefore, it is considered to be as a Layer 1 component. The electrical signals can be sent through the copper wire, fibre optics, atmosphere,
                water, and vacuum.
                <br>
                <br> The characteristics and quality of data transmission are determined by the characteristics of medium and signal. Transmission media is of two types are wired media and wireless media. In wired media, medium characteristics are more
                important whereas, in wireless media, signal characteristics are more important. Different transmission media have different properties such as bandwidth, delay, cost and ease of installation and maintenance. The transmission media is
                available in the lowest layer of the OSI reference model, i.e., Physical layer.
                <br>
                <br> Transmission media are of two types âˆ’
                <br>- Wired / Guided media
                <br>- Wireless / Unguided media
